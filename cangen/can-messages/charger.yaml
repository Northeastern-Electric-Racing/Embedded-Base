    # Fault info Charger/Box/FaultStatus
    # Bit 0: 0: Normal. 1: Hardware Failure
    # Bit 1: 0: Normal. 1: Over temperature protection
    # Bit 2: 0: Input voltage is normal. 1. Input voltage is wrong, the charger will stop working
    # Bit 3: 0: Battery is connected normally.
    # Bit 4: 1: Battery is not connected or the battery is connected reversely.
    # Bit 5: 0: Communication is normal. 1: Communication receive time-out.
